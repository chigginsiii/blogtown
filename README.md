# Chiggins.com in JekyllVision

If memory serves, [Chiggins.com](http://chiggins.com) has been built at one time or another on:

- static html
- Mason-based blog with homegrown gallery
- MovableType
- WordPress
- static html again
- Drupal

Now I'm doing it with Jekyll and Bootstrap, and it's purdy fun stuff.
